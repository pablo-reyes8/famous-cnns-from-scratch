This repository contains **from-scratch implementations** of several iconic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures using **PyTorch**.  
Each model is built manually without relying on `torchvision.models`, providing full control over architecture design, training loops, and visualization of what the network learns.

## üìå Implemented Architectures

- **LeNet-5 (1998)** ‚Äì One of the earliest CNNs, designed for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST). Introduced convolution + pooling + fully connected layers, laying the foundation of deep learning for vision.  
- **AlexNet (2012)** ‚Äì The breakthrough model that won ILSVRC 2012. Popularized deep CNNs, GPU training, ReLU activations, and dropout, marking the start of the modern deep learning era.  
- **U-Net (2015)** ‚Äì A U-shaped encoder‚Äìdecoder architecture for semantic segmentation. Introduced skip connections to preserve spatial information and became the standard in medical imaging and beyond.  
- **ResNet-50 (2015)** ‚Äì Residual networks that solved the vanishing gradient problem, enabling training of ultra-deep architectures. ResNet-50 remains one of the most widely used backbones in computer vision.

## üîÆ Planned Implementations

- **Inception (GoogLeNet, 2014)** ‚Äì Multi-branch convolutional architecture with factorized filters and auxiliary classifiers, reducing computational cost while improving accuracy.
- **VGG Net**
- **Mobile Net**
- **Dense Net**

## üöÄ Features

- Implementations built **line-by-line from scratch** in PyTorch.  
- Modular code: layers, residual blocks, and classifier heads defined separately.  
- Works with standard datasets like **MNIST**, **STL-10**, **Oxford-IIIT Pets**, and **CIFAR-10**.  
- **Training utilities**: progress bars, mixed precision support, top-k accuracy metrics.  
- **Evaluation utilities**: Grad-CAM, feature map visualization, confusion matrices, embeddings (t-SNE/UMAP).

## üñº Visualization Examples

- **Predictions on the test set**  
  Display grids of correct vs. incorrect predictions with labels.  

- **Feature Maps & Filters**  
  Inspect learned kernels and intermediate activations across layers.  

- **Grad-CAM Heatmaps**  
  Visualize which regions of the image drive the network‚Äôs decisions.  

- **Embeddings**  
  Project high-dimensional feature representations into 2D with UMAP/t-SNE to explore class separability.  

These tools provide insights into **what CNNs learn internally**, from low-level filters to high-level semantic representations.
